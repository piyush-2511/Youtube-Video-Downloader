# Video Downloader

This is a web application that allows users to download videos from provided links in their desired format. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend logic is implemented in Python.

## Features

- Input a video link to download.
- Choose the desired format for downloading (e.g., MP4, MP3, etc.).
- Responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Client-side logic and interaction.

### Backend
- **Python**: Handles server-side logic and video downloading functionality.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
- Python (>= 3.7)
- pip (Python package installer)
- A web browser

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Youtube-Video-Downloader.git
   cd Youtube-Video-Downloader
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Open the frontend:
   - Open `templates/index.html` in your browser or navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` if your backend serves the frontend.

## How It Works

1. Enter the video link in the input field.
2. Choose the format for downloading.
3. Click the download button.
4. The backend processes the request, fetches the video, and prepares it for download in the selected format.
